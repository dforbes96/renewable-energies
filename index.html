        <h1>Overview</h1>
            
        <p>
            Over the past decade, the adverse effect of the mining and usage of fossil fuels has become more apparent.
            Resultant pollution does clear damage to the ecosystems of animals and the environments that people live in.
            The pressing question is: what to do about it?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Many scientists and civilians alike make the argument to switch entirely to clean, renewable energy sources.
            They pose almost no threat to the surrounding environment, and are virtually infinite in abundance.
            Such a solution seems very tempting at first glance. But is it practical enough to fill an entire country’s energy needs?
            And might there be drawbacks? Let’s look at the advantages and disadvantages of both fossil fuels and clean energy.
        </p>
        
        <p>First, let’s list the type of resources each category consists of…</p>
        
        <div id="lists"> <!-- Div created to post image beside list -->
        <p>Types of Fossil Fuel Energy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coal</li>
            <li>Crude Oil/Petroleum</li>
            <li>Natural Gas</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Types of Renewable Energy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wind</li>
            <li>Solar</li>
            <li>Hydro[electric]</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <img src="images/sun.png" height="250" width="250">
        <p>
            To begin, fossils fuels are extremely efficient, generating outputs amounts of energy even in small amounts. Petroleum, for example, is the primary fuel source for standard cars that run on gasoline, and is found to be the most effective fuel.
            Renewable resources such as electricity (which can power electric cars) doesn’t come close to the energy output of petroleum. Fossil fuels are also more convenient to transport.
            Coal, petroleum, and natural gas have a tangible form that can be contained and carried from point A to Point B with ease; whereas wind, solar and hydro energy can only power the surrounding area.
            The demand for fossil fuels generates tens of thousands of jobs (approx. 42,000), and job provision is vital in the current United States economy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            However, with the good comes the bad. Fossil fuels, as previously stated, are health hazards. The burning of fuels such as coal and oil generates carbon emissions that contaminate the air and damage the environment and those living in it.
            According to the World Health Organization, 7 million deaths are caused by air pollution annually. And when salvaging fossil fuels goes wrong, the consequences are horrid.
            The most familiar example is the BP Oil Spill of 2010 off the Gulf of Mexico, leaking an astonishing 3.19 million barrels into the ocean. Environmental damage is still being repaired, and most likely will not be finished for years to come.
            In addition, stations that harness fossil fuels require large amounts of coal to be shipped from miles away in order to power them.
            As a result, maintaining these stations is incredibly expensive, and may only get more expensive as fossil fuels deplete.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now to examine clean energy. As the phrase suggests, energy produced from renewable resources is clean, generating little to no carbon emissions or other toxic byproducts.
            Few emissions means cleaner air and a cleaner environment, reversing some of the effects done by air pollution and slowing climate change.
            Growth in the clean energy industry will also lead to availability of jobs, counteracting those that could potentially be lost if the fossil fuel industry were to downsize or cease.
            The bestselling point of renewable resources is that they are virtually infinite; so long as there is a sun, wind, and flowing water, energy can be harvested from them.
            These natural forces will be present for millennia to come, so scarcity is not an issue compared to fossil fuels.
            Because of this, prices related to using clean energy will be much more stable due to lack of scarcity, in contrast with limited fossil fuels.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            On the other hand, there would be some obstacles in using this form of energy. Some have already been stated. Energy harvested from natural forces can only be used in areas close by.
            Not to mention limits to where plants can be set up. For instance, hydroelectric dams can only be set up where there are fast-running rivers, and wind turbines would need vast open areas (particularly rural).
            Efficiency is also a problem. Compared to fossil fuels, clean energy doesn’t generate nearly as much energy at the same ratio.
            Significantly more clean energy facilities would be needed to replace or rival fossil fuel facilities, which goes back to the dilemma of location limitation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            These are only some of the arguments for or against renewable energy and fossil fuel energy. So it should be asked again: What is the nation to do?
            From a general view of the two energy methods, many of the cons of one are cancelled out by the pros of the other. Reasonably speaking, a proper balance of both would be ideal.
            As the way things currently stand, I would say less oil rigs and coal mining facilities, more wind turbines and solar power plants.
            Ultimately, it is important to keep the well-being of nature and its ecosystems in mind for a better future.
